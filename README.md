## :book: About

This project consists of an RPG type singleplayer video game i am making. The whole idea came from me liking and playing a lot of different RPG games like World of Warcraft, OldSchool Runescape.
The project itself is in early stages of development, but early means there is a ton of stuff to come in the future!

## :wrench: Functionality

WannaBeRpg is a low poly game, so it can run on a lot of systems!
Also, the game offers
- Stats and various weapons to kill your enemies.
- Interesting quests and tasks for you to complete.
- Various types of enemies for you to kill.
- Cool music soundtrack to listen to.
- Beautiful map for you to explore.

> [!NOTE]
> Some features may still be in development or not implemented at all.
