## :book: About

This project consists of an RPG type singleplayer video game i am making. The whole idea came from me liking and playing a lot of different RPG games like World of Warcraft, OldSchool Runescape.
The project itself is in early stages of development, but early means there is a ton of stuff to come in the future!
